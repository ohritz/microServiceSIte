# TODO

- Research service discovery
    - how do we tell nginx about instances of the webserver..
    - do we have internal loadbalancing so that we can increase instances of the api?
- Research react server side rendering / express view engine?
- Write build scripts and dev/test compose/docker files
    - develop each component in isolation?
    - Dockerfiles/compose for different scenarios.
